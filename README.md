### Medical Robotics assignment

Implementation is in pure Matlab. You can reproduce the reported results running the corresponing scripts.

### T1) Compute in symbolic form the matrix A_8^12


### T2) Given the bounds of q compute points of the 3D-working space


### T3) Solve the inverse kinematics problem, or given compatible values with the kinematic configuration of matrix T


### T4) Select any spiral trajectory within your working space where the coordinates x y z are not expressed necessarily with respect to the coordinate system. Approximate two circular motions of this spiral with at least 36 2 ? points under the assumption that T =1. Solve for these 72 points the inverse kinematics problem by computing q


### T5) Under the assumption that two successive points are connected by a third order polynomial with a stop-and-go trajectory plot the joint trajectories and the resulting end-effector trajectory
